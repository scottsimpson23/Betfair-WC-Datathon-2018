determine base K from lookup table (inner join on k value table)
insert game index integer

set first row to 1311 (current median) OR initialise to 1998 closing rating?  OR 1388 (1998 closing rating median)

for each game in game index {
  
  calculate K value based on goal difference 
  
  set Rn to Rn-1 for all countries (use game index integer)
  
  calculate We from difference in rating for each team
  
  calculate Rn and write into column for each team
